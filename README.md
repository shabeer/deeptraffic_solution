#My solution to DeepTraffic competition organized by MIT.

My deep learning architecture attaining 72.5 mph of max 80 mph using Deep Q-learning, [Convnet.js](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) popular convolutional neural network library -  in DeepTraffic competition organized by [MIT course 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/)
    
Various architectures attaining different speeds are uploaded to git.
